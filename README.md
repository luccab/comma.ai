This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app was made using react and [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/) (made by Uber). The app is hosted on Heroku and can be found [here](https://react-comma.herokuapp.com/).

## JSON files

I uploaded all of them to S3 and then I took all the information I needed and converted to one JSON file through [this script](https://github.com/luccab/rawJSON/blob/master/aws.js).

I am further explaining the code in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2voHT4JjvMA).
